# Introduction to the Concept of Machine Learning


## Objectives

* Greetings/Announcements

* Students work on training their machine - they will present these at the end of class and upload them to canvas - Must have 1 class per student
  - Groups of 2-3
* 15 minute break 
* Check in on Student Status
* Students Present their Teachable Machines
  - Discuss how to submit assignment
* 15 minute break
* Discussion about projects and what was learned (15-20 mins)
 - Do findings on Jamboard
* [Introduction to R Syntax and Output](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EFB_0ZBCwo4ShVWQzItLMy39UBuWcOmqj5dU-ki55_Y/edit?usp=sharing)
```R
    5+7
    x <- 2  # Defining variable (variables are case sensitive)
    x <- 3  

    x # outputs value stored by x

    y <- c(1,2,3,4,5) # c is the concatenation operator
    y <- 1:10         # creates a vector with 10 values from 1 to 10
    x <- y <- 1:10    # x and y equal to same thing

    z <- x+y          # adds together the items at each index

    z2 <- x-y     # subtracts together the items at each index

    ls()    #outputs all values in workspace

    rm(x)     #clears the x var from the workspace

    rm(list = ls)   #clears all variables


    browseURL("http://www.google.com")  #Opens up browser and goes to Url


    library() #gives list of all packages installed
    search() #list of packages currently installed and usable
